The Repo contains assignment submissions made in the course [CS330](2022-23 Sem. I) in a team of 4:

The assignments required us to implement programs, syscalls, scheduling algorithms, synchronization primitives, etc. in the xv6 OS evironment. 
There is also a report corresponding to each assignment, which can be found in the corresponding directory.

- Assignment#1-Part A: Implement user programs which use syscalls like getpid(), fork(), pipe(), etc.
- Assignment#1-Part B: Implement syscalls like getppid(), waitpid(), custom implementation of fork(), process info, etc.
- Assignment#2: Implement four scheduling algorithms: non-preemptive FCFS, non-preemptive SJF, preemptive RR, and preemptive UNIX scheduler, and compare them using some statistics.
- Assignment#3: Implement Condition Variables and Semaphores and use them in the barrier problem and the MP-MC BB problem (Multiple Producers-Multiple Consumers Bounded Buffer Problem).
